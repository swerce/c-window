# Creating a GUI window in C
This program demonstrates how to create a basic GUI window in C without any external modules.

# Prerequisites
C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
For Windows: MinGW or Visual Studio (if using Visual Studio, some modifications may be required)
For Unix-based systems: Xlib development library
# How to build and run
Windows
Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code file main.c.
Compile the code using
```bash
  gcc main.c -o main
```
Run the program using 
```bash
  main.exe
```
# Unix-based systems
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code file 
```bash
  main.c
```
Compile the code using
```bash
  gcc main.c -o main -lX11.
```
Run the program using
```bash
  ./main
```
# How it works
The program uses conditional compilation to differentiate between Windows and Unix-based systems, as the method for creating GUI windows is different for each.
On Windows, the program uses the Win32 API to register a window class, create a window, and enter a message loop. On Unix-based systems, the program uses Xlib to create a simple window, map it to the screen, and wait for a key press event.
